# agile-fika-static

- Agile fika for github pages

## Whats it for?

- Well quite simply for those morning standups where you need to remember what you did and are doing! I know I forget alot!
- Anything you set as Today will move to Yesterday automatically once tomorrow arrives :)
- Issues are static and wont fall off the list as we all know those pesky things can hang around for a while
